# Payments

DenoX payments live behind a provider abstraction (`PaymentProvider`) — Stripe first, implemented
over its **plain HTTPS REST API with native `fetch` + Web Crypto** (no SDK, zero dependencies).
Checkout pages are hosted by Stripe: card data never touches your app.

## Enabling

```ts
// denox.config.ts
payments: {
  provider: "stripe",   // default "none" → endpoints answer 501
  currency: "usd",
  successPath: "/",     // gets ?payment=<id> appended
  cancelPath: "/",
}
```

```bash
# .env — fail-fast required once provider is "stripe"
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_...      # or sk_test_...
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...
```

## Endpoints

| Method | Path                     | Auth        | Description               |
| ------ | ------------------------ | ----------- | ------------------------- |
| POST   | `/api/payments/checkout` | user        | Create hosted checkout    |
| POST   | `/api/payments/webhook`  | signature   | Provider status callbacks |
| GET    | `/api/payments/:id`      | owner/admin | Payment details           |
| GET    | `/api/payments`          | admin       | Listing                   |

Checkout body: `{ "productId": "..." }` **or**
`{ "amountCents": 1990, "currency": "brl", "description": "..." }` (exactly one mode). In product
mode the amount comes **exclusively** from the stored price — client amounts are rejected — and the
payment persists a `productSnapshot { id, name, price }` so purchase history survives product
edits/deletion. Response: `{ paymentId, status, url }` → redirect the buyer to `url`.

## Webhook setup

1. Stripe Dashboard → Developers → Webhooks → Add endpoint:
   `https://your-app.deno.dev/api/payments/webhook`
2. Events: `checkout.session.completed`, `checkout.session.async_payment_failed`,
   `checkout.session.expired`.
3. Copy the signing secret into `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`.

Signatures are verified on the **raw body** (HMAC-SHA256, constant-time, 5-minute replay tolerance)
before any parsing; processed event ids are remembered for 24 h (KV TTL) so replays are acknowledged
without side effects. Unknown session ids return 200 with a structured warning.

## Local development

```bash
stripe listen --forward-to localhost:8000/api/payments/webhook
stripe trigger checkout.session.completed
```

Test card: `4242 4242 4242 4242`, any future date/CVC. The suite runs green with **no Stripe
account**: MockProvider covers the lifecycle and `STRIPE_API_BASE` points the real provider at a
local mock server.

## Statuses

`pending → paid | failed | expired` (this cycle). `processing`, `cancelled` and `refunded` are
reserved states for future events/refund support.
